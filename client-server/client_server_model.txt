The provider of a resource or a service is known as a server
The service requesters are called clients 
Client sends a request and the server returns a response. 
To formalize data exchange even futher, the server may implement an application programming interface (API)

HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Stateless Protocl = Does not have to retain information about each user. However this can be done using sessions, http cookies, or url rewriting.HTTP is made of 3 blocks

3 Blocks:
Start-Line: Method, uri, HTTP Method ex: GET /pages/index.html HTTP /1:0

Headers: Name value pairs. HOST(addreses of the server where we are sending the request), Accept(Accept type we are requesting), Accept-language: en-us. 

Body: Contains the files we are connected

HTTP is insecure because information is not encrypted. It is easy to put yourself in the middle and catch information.

HTTPS (Hypper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)

HTTP over TLS
HTTP over SSL
HTTP Secure

Information is encrypted.

To secure the website you have to purchase an SSL certifiate. SSL certificate is like an online verification card. the SSL certificat will encrypt any information.
