To avoid using passwords when connecting to a virtual private server one can use SSH keys. Generating a key pair provides you with two long strings of charcers: a public and a private key. You can place the public key on any server and then unblock it by connecting to it with a client that already has the private key. After generating the public and private key you can take your public SSH key and add it to the server. 

For example, lets say you wanted to SSH into GitLab. You would create a new SSH key pair using the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.email@example.com" -b 4096. If you choose the default configurtion settings, the public SSH key will be placed in id_rsa.pub and the private SSH key will be placed in id_rsa. We can then copy the public SSH key onto gitlab. 

After doing so one must add their private key to the ssh-agent. To do this one should run ssh-add. ssh-add command prompts the user for a private key password and addits it to the list maintained by ssh-agent. 

ssh-agent is a background program that handles passwords for SSH Private keys.
