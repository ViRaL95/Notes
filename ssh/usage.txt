ssh-keygen allows you to create a new ssh key
ssh-add adds adds your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication
Port 22 is the default SSH port
One of the first thing that happens wehn the SSH connection is being established is that the server sends its public key to the client and proves to the client that it knows the associated private key. If this part of the protocol is succesfull, the client knows that the server is who it pretends to be

In order to check that the server is a known one it remembers the servers you have already connected to in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file on the client machine.
